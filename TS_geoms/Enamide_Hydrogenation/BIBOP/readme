Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of &beta;-aryl-N-acetyl enamides using BIBOP ligand.

Geometries from Y. Guan and S. E. Wheeler, "Automated Quantum Mechanical Predictions of Enantioselectivity in a Rh-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation", Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 56, 9101 (2017).

TS structures are for the two H-transfer steps, and are named as in Scheme 2 from the reference above, with 'a' replacing &alpha; and 'b' replacing &beta;.
For example, TS1&beta;1 from Scheme 2 is TS1/tsb1.xyz below.  
TS1&beta;2 and TS1&alpha;2 are omitted from the library because they tend to be very high in energy.

For experiments, see G. Liu, X. Liu, Z. Cai, G. Jiao, G. Xu, W. Tang, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.  2013, 52, 4235-4238.

Note: Assumes C2-symmetric ligand!
